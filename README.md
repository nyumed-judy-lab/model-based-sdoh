## Implementation of Model-based Estimation of Individual-level Social Determinants of Health (SDoH)

The code covers how to obtain the estimated associations between SDoH variables and demographic covariates in the American Community Survey data.

The code performs the following four steps:

1. Date Preprocessing
2. Variable Selection
3. Plot of estimates of weighted correlation and their standard deviations from step 2
4. SDoH Model
